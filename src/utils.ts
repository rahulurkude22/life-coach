      "Hi, I'm Shivali Khanna. Today, I attended a very good session by Mrs. Alisha. It was a life coach session about time, family, life, career, and how to manage my time for my family and my career. With this session, it was a very self-realization session where I realized what are my goals in life and how I should work towards them, how I should manage my time between my career and my kids. She gave me a lot of coaching tips, a lot of ideas, and how, as a person, I should value my strengths and weaknesses. I I should improve my weaknesses as a person. So yes, it was a great session. I'm feeling very, very light. I came with a very heavy mind, a very overthinking mind, and solutions are the best way to finish a problem. I'm very happy with this session, and I would really, really, I'm thankful to Alicia for helping me out plan my day and to move towards my goal. Thank you so much, Alisha, for this session.",

      " Life is itself a learning process. Life coach, I never understood and didn't know. I came here as a interaction. But I got this wheel which I wanted to mark myself as a result of my points. I got to know how many things I'm in, how many things I have, and how many things I have to work on. So at this date, I'm taking a lot of questions. I'm going to go home and do a lot of homework at home, on which I'm going to. I will work, and how can I get in progress, how can I get in personal growth? The thing I have never thought has been ignited, that question has arised. So this was a very helpful session. And I feel like as many girls. I think that all girls who have come here, they are all going to go home and think about their self-growth. I think unfold is the correct name, which has us too, we have a lot of things unfold. After this, the real session is ours. After this, the real session is ours. After this, the real session is ours. Has unfold. After this, the real session will start.",
