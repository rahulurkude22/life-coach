      "Alisha is a compassionate coach. In my interactions with her, I have found her questions to be deeply insightful, and she takes the time to sit with you and truly understand where you're coming from. Her ability to take the information you share and guide you toward discovering your own solutions is truly remarkable. I find her to be an extremely grounded and sorted person.She takes her time in responding, with a genuine desire to help and to understand the situation. She creates an environment where you feel comfortable sharing and getting to the root of your thoughts, helping you activate your solution-focused mindset and find great ideas for how to move forward.I wholeheartedly recommend Alisha as a coach and wish her all the best.",

With this session, it was a very self-realization session where I realized what are my goals in life and how I should work towards them, how I should manage my time between my career and my kids. She gave me a lot of coaching tips, a lot of ideas, and how, as a person, I should value my strengths and weaknesses. I I should improve my weaknesses as a person. So yes, it was a great session. I'm feeling very, very light. I came with a very heavy mind, a very overthinking mind, and solutions are the best way to finish a problem.
